title: Yield Farming
---

User will get Liquidity Provider (LP) tokens as their credentails for adding liquidity into the liquidity pool. They can deposit the LP tokens into the yield farming pool of the corresponding LP tokens to earn more. This is similar to how other yield-farming protocols (e.g. [SushiSwap](https://sushiswap.fi/pools))work, but with some interesting variations.

Based on the community-first principle, we make the yield farming more open to community. Specifically, 
- It is permissionless to join/leave the yield farming pool anytime. Your LP token is safe guaranteed by the Blockchain.
- Anyone can add **yield drop** to the yield farming pool. They can configure and schedule airdrops to the yield farming pool periodically. Many token holders would like to further incentivize community participations themselves for the long-term benefit of their other token holdings.

Users can query the upcoming yield drop through our RPC interface or through our block browser. Each yield drop is shared by all users pro rata to their LP shares in the yield farming pool when the yield drop occurs. Users' collective rewards are automatically accumulated in the pool and can be claimed anytime.
