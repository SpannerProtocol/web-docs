Spanner Protocol has following three major launch phases:

**Phase 1 - Hammer Testnet**: Launched on Dec 2020. A value-free playground for experimental protocol and feature upgrades. Partners can connect to the testnet RPC endpoints for integration. The testnet may have bugs and unexpected reboots. Check out the [integration guide](integration_guide.md) for more information.

**Phase 2 - Spanner Mainnet**: Scheduled on Launch on the first quarter of 2021. The mainnet is the first official release of Spanner Protocol where the native token BOLT will have real value. 

**Phase 3 - Spanner Parachain**: After the official launch of Polkadot parachain integraiton, we will bid for a parachain slot with wide community supports. The parachain integration is anticipated to bring higher value of BOLT token via improved interoperability and pool security.
