## Launch Phases
Spanner Protocol has following three major launch phases:

**Phase 1 - Hammer Testnet**: Launched Dec 2020. A value-free playground for experimental protocol and feature upgrades. Partners can connect to the testnet RPC endpoints for integration. The testnet may have bugs and unexpected reboots. Check out the [integration guide](integration_guide.md) for more information.

**Phase 2 - Spanner Mainnet**: Scheduled to Launch in the first quarter of 2021. The mainnet is the first official release of Spanner Protocol where the native token BOLT will be available in our liquidity pools.

**Phase 3 - Spanner Parachain**: After the official launch of Polkadot parachain integration, we will bid for a parachain slot with community-wide support. The parachain integration is anticipated to benefit Spanner and BOLT token via improved interoperability and pool security. 

## Feature Roadmap
We will progressively implement following features and more. 
- Economy of Scale for pricing Spanner components and templates
- More Growth Templates to supoort more project launches.
- More features for interoperability with other Parachain and integration. 
- Parachain infrastructure like Collator. 

The actual implementation schedule are evolving based on our github issue discussion pages.
