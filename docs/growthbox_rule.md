title: Genesis Package
---

A Genesis Package is a yield generating product designed to help projects grow by allowing them to fundraise for their project, improve liquidity and stabilize volatility of token prices. 
This benefits both project and backers by encouraging holders to use the token with less fear of sudden prices drops and to have longer term perspectives.<br/>

Specifically, a Genesis Package works as follows in chronological order:
- Token Lockup
- Gives Bonus: gives the buyer a one-time bonus upon purchased 
- Gives Yield: gives the buyer periodic rewards over a given time period. 
  If a milestone of total Genesis Package was met, the buyer gets extra yield (i.e. the Milestone Airdrop). 
- Token Un-lockup

A Genesis Package can be purchased by either a token holder or a [DPO](dpo_rule.md). Again, a Genesis Package only **gives tokens** in the long run and is designed to benefit both **the projects and their early adopters**. 

Anyone can create Genesis Package offerings or schedule Milestone Airdrop for the collective good of project communities.
