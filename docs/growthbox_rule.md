title: GrowthBox Rules
---

A GrowthBox is a yield generating deposit offering both a one time participation bonus and a passive periodic yield. GrowthBoxes help projects grow by allowing them to fundraise for their project, improve liquidity and stabilize volatility of token prices. This benefits both project and backers by encouraging holders to use the token with less fear of sudden prices drops and to have longer term perspectives.

A GrowthBox can be activated by either an token holder or a [DPO](dpo_rule.md). A GrowthBox is defined by following major attributes:
- Lock amount and lock period: the committer needs to lock up the required amount to initiate the GrowthBox. The locked tokens will unlock automatically after the lock period.
- Instant Drop: token drops for the committer instantly upon GrowthBox activation.
- Periodic Drop: drop X tokens to the committer every Y blocks throughout the whole lock period upon GrowthBox activation. 

As you can see, a GrowthBox only **gives tokens** in the long run. The token is not minted, it is from the total supply. It is designed to benefit both **the projects and the committer**. Anyone can create a GrowthBox if they want to participate in catalyzing community growth.

### Milestone Drop
A Milestone Drop is a scheduled token airdrop for hitting a milestone, which can be flexibly defined. In our first launch, a Milestone Drop is activated by metrics of GrowthBox and DPO and its token reward package will be fairly distributed to the target audiences. It is like how Uniswap/1inch airdrop tokens for their early backers. 

For example, 
- 10000 BOLT token drop to all GrowthBox committers when 5 GrowthBoxes in total are activated.
- 10000 BOLT token drop to all DPO managers when totally 15 GrowthBoxes were activated.

Anyone who want to incentivize community growth can schedule a Milestone Drop.
