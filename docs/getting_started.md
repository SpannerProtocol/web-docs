We maintain a list of high quality articles for new comers to understand our vision, roadmap and features. If you have not read our [Medium blogs](https://spannerprotocol.medium.com/), then you are recommended to start from there. 

## What's Spanner's Vision and Strategy?
[Solving the Contract Trilemma](https://spannerprotocol.medium.com/solving-the-contract-trilemma-33e493f56596)

To achieve this goal, we need more than just technological innovation. We need users, adoption and useful feedback to improve the Spanner Protocol. Our first strategic move is to help projects launch and grow on Spanner Protocol. Weâ€™re certain that our success is intricately tied to the success of projects using our protocol.

## Why Projects want to launch on Spanner?
Our primary strategic intent is to [help projects succeed launching on Spanner](https://spannerprotocol.medium.com/how-spanner-helps-projects-to-succeed-3eb00d6a7c74). 

We postulate that a successful decentralised token project needs 3 key elements: asset, liquidity and growth. Specifically, a token project needs to issue their assets (e.g. tokens), provision liquidity to the tokens through exchange platforms and devise a strategy to grow their community (e.g. users and token holders). 

Spanner provides asset, liquidity and growth. **3-in-1 on Spanner Protocol**. 

Specifically, we provide following tools built on solid decentralized protocol and designed with **community-first** in mind: 
- Out-of-box templates: projects can launch on with pre-built growth templates.
- liquid markets: wallets, users, DEX and more.
