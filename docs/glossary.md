Spanner Protocol is building on the fast-evolving and battle-tested blockchain development framework Substrate. For Substrate-related terms like BABE, Collator and Extrinsic etc., please refer to [the Polkadot wiki](https://wiki.polkadot.network/docs/en/glossary) for more information. 

This document will focus on terminology relavant to our products, features and technologies.

#### Components
A component is built for a specifc purpose set like vesting payments and securing funds. For example, using a secure fund Vault component in a crowdfunding application can give users assurance of fund safety by preventing crowdfunders from misusing funds beyond the defined scope. They can be bundled together to solve even larger problems. Spanner components are built into the protocol and optimized for scale.

#### Growth Components
A Growth Component is a specific component that focuses on project growth. The overall design principles for ([Growth Components](https://spannerprotocol.medium.com/growth-template-1-growthbox-and-dpo-518bab21ea4d) ) include:
- Simplicity: It is as easy to use as creating a token contract.
- Provable Solvency: This means the promised token reward set by the project teams are guaranteed to payout as agreed upon. This is guaranteed via Spanner smart contracts.
- Separation of Concerns: Project teams just need to create simple token reward options. The incentivized promotion of your project (incentive plan), its community and structure are determined by community leaders and professional promoters.

#### BulletTrain
BulletTrain, a Growth Component, is a yield generating deposit offering both a one time participation bonus and a passive periodic yield. BulletTrain help projects grow by allowing them to fundraise for their project, improve liquidity and stabilize volatility of token prices. This benefits both project and backers by encouraging holders to use the token with less fear of sudden prices drops and to have longer term perspectives.

#### Decentralized Programmable Organization (DPO)
The name DPO should be self-explanatory - providing a programmable template for people to collaborate as a formal organization. Check out our Medium article [Introducing DPO](https://spannerprotocol.medium.com/introducing-dpo-e4ca0730e1c) for its design rationale and principles.
