Spanner Protocol is building on the fast-evolving and battle-tested blockchain development framework Substrate. For Substrate-related terms like BABE, Collator and Extrinsic etc., please refer to [the Polkadot wiki](https://wiki.polkadot.network/docs/en/glossary) for more information. 

This document will focus on terminology relavant to our products, features and technologies.

#### Components
A component is built for a specifc purpose set like vesting payments and securing funds. For example, using a secure fund Vault component in a crowdfunding application can give users assurance of fund safety by preventing crowdfunders from misusing funds beyond the defined scope. Spanner components are built into the protocol and optimized for scale.

#### Template
Templates are like bundles of Components put together for a specific purpose akin to Smart Contracts.

#### Growth Template
Specific Templates that assist Projects in their growth. They are designed based on advanced Game Theory and Mechanism Design. The first Growth template we launch is [GT-01](https://spannerprotocol.medium.com/growth-template-1-growthbox-and-dpo-518bab21ea4d) which includes the GrowthBox and DPO.

#### GT-01
A Growth Template that utilizes GrowthBox and DPO templates to incentivize growth. The overall design principles for the Growth Template #1 ([GT-01](https://spannerprotocol.medium.com/growth-template-1-growthbox-and-dpo-518bab21ea4d) ) include:
- Simplicity: It is as easy to use as creating a token contract.
- Provable Solvency: This means the promised token reward set by the project teams are guaranteed to payout as agreed upon. This is guaranteed via Spanner smart contracts.
- Separation of Concerns: Project teams just need to create simple token reward options. The incentivized promotion of your project (incentive plan), its community and structure are determined by community leaders and professional promoters.

#### GrowthBox
A GrowthBox is a yield generating deposit offering both a one time participation bonus and a passive periodic yield. GrowthBoxes help projects grow by allowing them to fundraise for their project, improve liquidity and stabilize volatility of token prices. This benefits both project and backers by encouraging holders to use the token with less fear of sudden prices drops and to have longer term perspectives.

#### Decentralized Programmable Organization (DPO)
The name DPO should be self-explanatory - providing a programmable template for people to collaborate as a formal organization. Check out our Medium article [Introducing DPO](https://spannerprotocol.medium.com/introducing-dpo-e4ca0730e1c) for its design rationale and principles.
