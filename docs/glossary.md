Spanner Protocol is building on the fast-evolving and battle-tested blockchain development framework Substrate. For substrate-retated terms like BABE, Collator and Extrinsic etc., please refer to [here](https://wiki.polkadot.network/docs/en/glossary) for answers. 

We will focus on explaining terms relavant to our major products and features here. 
### Components
A component is built for a specifc purpose set like vesting payment and secure fund vault. For example, using a secure fund vault component in a crowdfunding application can give users assurance of fund safety that the manager can not use them outside the defined scope. Spanner components are built into the protocol and optimized for mass usages.

### Template
Templates are like bundles of Components put together for a specific purpose akin to Smart Contracts.
### Growth Template
specific Templates that assist Projects in their growth. They are designed based on advanced Game Theory and Mechanism Design. The first Growth template we launch is [GT-01](https://spannerprotocol.medium.com/growth-template-1-growthbox-and-dpo-518bab21ea4d) which includes the GrowthBox and DPO.

### GT-01
The overall design principles for the Growth Template #1 ([GT-01](https://spannerprotocol.medium.com/growth-template-1-growthbox-and-dpo-518bab21ea4d) ) include:
- Simplicity: It is as easy to use as creating a token contract.
- Provable Solvency: This means the promised token reward set by the project teams are guaranteed to payout as agreed upon. This is guaranteed via Spanner smart contracts.
- Separation of Concerns: Project teams just need to create simple token reward options. The incentivized promotion of your project (incentive plan), its community and structure are determined by community leaders and professional promoters.
### Growth Box
A Growth Box is a yield generating deposit offering both a one time participation bonus and a passive periodic yield. Growth Boxes help projects grow by allowing them to fundraise for their project, improve liquidity and stabilize volatility of token prices. This benefits both project and backers by encouraging holders to use the token with less fear of sudden prices drops and to have longer term perspectives.
### Decentralized Programmable Organization (DPO)
The name DPO should be self-explanatory - providing a programmable template for people to collaborate as a formal organization. Check [this](https://spannerprotocol.medium.com/introducing-dpo-e4ca0730e1c) Medium post out for its design rational and principles.
