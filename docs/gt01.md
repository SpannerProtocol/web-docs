The basic idea of the Spanner Growth Component SGC-01 is very simple yet effective. 
It offers early adopters yield-generating packages on deposits (GrowthBox) 
and allow communities to crowdfund for purchasing GrowthBoxes 
using DPO, a novel Affiliate Crowdfunding model. 
DPO innovates crowdfunding by exploiting the power of affiliate marketing, a growth approach via social-network viral effects.

The insight is to enable separation of concernsï¼š *"Projects grow projects, communities grow communities"*.

## GrowthBox
The bigger the GrowthBox size, the more rewards it gives. 
GrowthBoxes can be purchased by any individual user 
or a DPO, which enables buyers to earn more from bigger GrowthBoxes they could not afford individually.

GrowthBoxes give buyers
(1) periodic yields until the GrowthBox expires and 
(2) their deposit back when the GrowthBox expires. 
If the buyer is a DPO, GrowthBoxes will give (3) a bonus for its effort in growing the community.

Moreover, SGC-01 offers **Global Rewards** that gives *all buyers in record* a reward pro-rata to their deposit to GrowthBoxes.
Global Rewards are triggered by milestones of the total deposits made to GrowthBoxes.
Early buyers will receive more Global Rewards along the way from the same GrowthBox purchases. 
 
## DPO

DPO gives communities ownerships to define the objectives and incentives for their crowdfunding campaigns.
By doing this, communities will be able to adapt and create the most effective incentives to help projects acquire new users. 
In other words, DPO is fully decentralized and programmable, and thus the name *Decentralized Programmable Organization*.

DPO allows 
- Any user can create a DPO, known as a **Manager**, to crowdfund a GrowthBox to earn Management Fees.
- Any user can invite others, known as a **Referrer**, to join any DPO to earn referral bonus.
- Any user can join a DPO, known as a **Member**, to earn GrowthBox token rewards. 
  Users can join individually or create another DPO to join. 
  The latter forms the powerful **DPO Chain** pattern that allows crowdfunds to include other crowdfunds in order to reach a larger goal.
  Communities can extend the DPO Chain to **any length** by chaining more DPOs to it.
