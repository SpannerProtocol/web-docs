title: GT-01 Overview
---

GT-01 is designed to incentivize early adopters and stabalize the token market. It has a simple design but with a complex and interesting dynamics.

GT-01 includes three components:
- [Growth Box](growthbox_rule.md) is a major source of token rewards. It has several configurations (requirements and reward size) for different groups of participants. Users can commit to a Growth Box by himself or by crowdfunding with a DPO.
- [DPO](dpo_rule.md) is a template for creating an on-chain organization for crowdfunding. Users can participate in DPO crowdfunding by himself or by crowdfunding with another DPO (a powerful DPO in DPO pattern). DPO has an effective scheme to incentive **managers, referrers and early participants**.
- [Global Drop](globaldrop.md) is a milestone-based reward airdrop for all GT-01 participants. A milestone is measured by the total amount of token locked by Growth Box. Any one (but normally the founding team) can schedule a Global Drop reward for the collective good of community. Early participants will **passively** have more Global Drop rewards.
