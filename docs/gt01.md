**BulletTrain** is a viral growth marketing approach verifiable by blockchain data that incentivizes users to grow your project.
With BulletTrain, projects will be able to achieve 10x community growth over 
traditional marketing campaigns such as airdrops and influencer promotions. The results of such promotions are
hard to measure and lack verifiable metrics. It is often a misuse of tokens. We believe the best reward system
is *piece-rate*. Token rewards are given *strictly* according to one's contribution to project growth by 
on-chain tamper-proof data. BulletTrain is designed with the goal of making project promotion completely performance-driven.

This is how it works:
- It offers early adopters GrowthBoxes (yield generating packages on deposits). 
GrowthBoxes are designed to incentivize communities and improve liquidity. The bigger the GrowthBox, the more rewards it gives and the higher the purchase requirement.
- It provides DPO, a novel crowdfunding model based on affiliate marketing  
  for communities to collectively buy bigger GrowthBoxes they could not afford individually.
  A key DPO innovation is combining affiliate marketing and community-designed incentive structures for viral growth through social networks.
  DPO enables a new approach for growth where *"projects grow projects. communities grow communities"*.
  
## GrowthBox
GrowthBoxes provide incentives to buyers by providing:
- Periodic **yields** until the GrowthBox expires 
- Deposits back when the GrowthBox expires. 
- If the buyer is a DPO, GrowthBoxes will give a **bonus** for its efforts in growing the community.

BulletTrain offers **Global Rewards** to all GrowthBox buyers triggered by milestones of total deposits made. 
On reaching a milestone, the reward is distributed to all buyers thus-far. 
In other words, late buyers won't receive any past Global Rewards. 
 
Buyers must withdraw their yields from the GrowthBox at least every 7-days. 
Otherwise, 1% of the accumulated unwithdrawn yield will go to the user 
who withdraws on the buyer's behalf - a rule referred to as **Treasure Hunting**.

## DPO
DPO is an abbreviation for Decentralized Programmable Organization. Through DPO, the community sets their own
objectives, incentives and crowdfunding goals. By allowing this, communities can adapt and create the most 
effective incentives to help projects acquire new users. 

DPO is **fully open**, **fairly incentivized** and **infinitely scalable**:
- Any user can create a DPO to crowdfund a GrowthBox to earn Management Fees.
- Any user can invite others to join any DPO to earn referral bonus.
- Any user can join a DPO to earn GrowthBox rewards. Users can join individually or create another DPO to join.
  The latter forms a scalable **DPO Chain** pattern that enables crowdfunds to include other crowdfunds in order 
  to shoot for a larger goal. A DPO Chain can extend to **any length** by chaining more DPOs.
