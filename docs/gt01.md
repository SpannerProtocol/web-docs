The basic idea of the Spanner Growth Component SGC-01 is very simple yet effective. 
- It offers early adopters GrowthBoxes (yield generating packages on deposits).
The bigger the GrowthBox, the more rewards it gives.
- It provides DPO, a novel Affiliate Crowdfunding model, 
  for communities to crowdfund for bigger GrowthBoxes they could not afford individually.
DPO innovates crowdfunding with the power of affiliate marketing, a viral growth approach through social networks.
DPO is designed to enable a new paradigm for crypto projectsï¼š *"Projects grow projects, communities grow communities"*.

## GrowthBox
GrowthBoxes give buyers
- periodic yields until the GrowthBox expires and 
- their deposit back when the GrowthBox expires. 
- If the buyer is a DPO, GrowthBoxes will give a bonus for its efforts in growing the community.

Moreover, SGC-01 offers **Global Rewards** that gives *all GrowthBox buyers in record* a reward pro-rata to their depositx to GrowthBoxes.
Global Rewards are triggered by milestones of the total deposits made to GrowthBoxes.
Early buyers will receive more Global Rewards along the way from the same GrowthBox purchases. 
 
## DPO

DPO gives communities ownerships to define the objectives and incentives for their crowdfunding campaigns.
By doing this, communities will be able to adapt and create the most effective incentives to help projects acquire new users. 
In other words, DPO is fully decentralized and programmable, and thus the name *Decentralized Programmable Organization*.

DPO allows 
- Any user can create a DPO, known as a **Manager**, to crowdfund a GrowthBox to earn Management Fees.
- Any user can invite others, known as a **Referrer**, to join any DPO to earn referral bonus.
- Any user can join a DPO, known as a **Member**, to earn GrowthBox token rewards. 
  Users can join individually or create another DPO to join. 
  The latter forms the powerful **DPO Chain** pattern that allows crowdfunds to include other crowdfunds in order to reach a larger goal.
  Communities can extend the DPO Chain to **any length** by chaining more DPOs to it.
