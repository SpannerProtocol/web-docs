**BulletTrain** (a Spanner Growth Component) is an evolutionary viral growth marketing model running on the Spanner Blockchain. BulletTrain has two key innovations, first is **TravelCabin** - a *piece-rate* reward based on verifiable performance data for projects to provide as incentive to its community. Second is **DPO** (Decentralized Programmable Organization) - an autonomous organizational structure that enables fair and scalable community collaboration. Together, they allow projects to achieve 10x community growth over traditional campaigns such as airdrops and influencer promotions, where effectiveness is difficult to track and tokens are often misused. BulletTrain is designed with the goal of helping projects grow their communities. 

Projects can run their own BulletTrain by offering **TravelCabins** of different **TravelClasses** (reward tiers) to **Passengers** (users) and DPOs (groups of users). It's easier and encouraged for passengers to purchase a TravelCabin with others (as a DPO). Once boarded, Passengers will start receiving their **Benefits** (rewards) until the end of their journey.
  
## TravelCabins

Travel Cabins are reward generating packages of different classes offered to early adopters. They are designed to incentivize communities and improve liquidity. Higher tiered travel classes generate higher rewards and has a higher purchasing requirement.

Travel Cabins offer the following benefits to its passengers in varying amounts depending on the cabin's **Travel Class**:
- Periodic **yields** until the ride ends
- **Ticket Fares** back when the ride ends. 
- If the passenger is a DPO, the Travel Cabin will give an extra **Bonus** as a boarding gift for its efforts in growing the community.

BulletTrain offers **Global Rewards** to all Travel Cabin passengers triggered Ticket Fare collection milestones.
On reaching a milestone, the reward is distributed to all boarded passengers.
In other words, late passengers won't receive any past Global Rewards. 
 
Buyers must withdraw their yields from the Travel Cabins at least every 7-days. 
Otherwise, 1% of the accumulated unwithdrawn yield will go to the user 
who withdraws on the buyer's behalf - a rule referred to as **Treasure Hunting**.

<!-- ## A brief introduction to DPO -->
<!-- DPO is an abbreviation for Decentralized Programmable Organization. 
Through DPO, the community sets their own objectives, incentives and crowdfunding goals. 
By allowing this, communities can adapt and create the most effective incentives to help projects acquire new users.  -->

## Decentralized Programmable Organization (DPO)

DPO is a novel crowdfunding model extending from affiliate marketing. It offers a gateway for communities to collectively purchase better incentive packages they could not have afforded individually. DPOâ€™s programmability allows communities to design their own objectives and incentive structures, allowing greater market efficiencies over affiliate marketing. DPO enables a new approach to growth where "projects grow projects, communities grow communities."

DPO is **fully open**, **fairly incentivized** and **infinitely scalable**:
- Any user can create a DPO to purchase an incentive package to earn Management Fees.
- Any user can invite others to join any DPO to earn referral bonus.
- Any user can join a DPO to earn incentive package rewards. Users can join the DPO as an individual or create another DPO to join. The latter forms a scalable **DPO Chain** pattern that enables crowdfunds to include other crowdfunds to shoot for a larger goal. A DPO Chain can extend to **any length** by chaining more DPOs.

In BulletTrain, DPOs are communities that try to purchase a TravelCabin together. This empowers passengers to purchase TravelCabins that they could not have afforded individually. By utilizing DPOs, passengers are incentivized to invite more passengers to the project's BulletTrain.
