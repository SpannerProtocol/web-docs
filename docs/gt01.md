ChainFund is the first Spanner Growth Template designed to incentivize early adopters and stabalize the token market.
In simple words, ChainFund = Genesis Packages + DPO.
- [Genesis Packages](growthbox_rule.md) provide token rewards to early adopters. 
  It has several types with different requirements and reward configurations for serving different types of early adopters.
  Users can buy a Genesis Packages by himself or buy a more expensive but more rewarding one by crowdfunding through DPO. 
 In addition to the Genesis Package rewards, early adopters will also enjoy Milestone Airdrops that are activated by the total amount of tokens used for buying Genesis Packages.
Early participants will receive more Milestone Airdrop rewards than the latter ones.
  
- [DPO (Decentralized Programmable Organization)](dpo_rule.md) provides an organized way to crowdfund on Blockchain. 
DPO participants of different roles are collaborating on Blockchain in a transparent, consensus-driven and secure manner. 
Each DPO has only 100 seats which can be bought by any individual user or by another DPO. 
The latter forms the innovative **chained-DPO** (i.e. dpo in dpo) pattern that can scale to arbitrary crowdfund sizes. 
DPO is built with an effective scheme to incentive **managers, referrers and early participants**.
