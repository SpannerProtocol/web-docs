title: Build Projects on Spanner
---

Quickly build high-quality crypto projects on Spanner. As Spanner's catalogue of components grow, 
they will be made accessible to projects through our one-click-deployment marketplace. 
  
## Getting Started

Projects can quickly create their token and then add it to Spanner DEX Liquidity Pools in minutes.
This can be done without code and will be made available via our web application. 

*Spanner Components will be available for new projects after our Mainnet launch.* 


## Open collaboration

After Mainnet launch, open-source developers will be able to collaborate with us on creating components 
to solve problems for their own business verticals. The more projects, the more components. 
Since inception, we envisioned having a component for every challenge and this mission will require help from our open-source community.
We believe that Spanner's success is intricately bound to the success of its projects. 

## BOLT Tokens: Role in Components

On Spanner, components are composable and each component used within a larger component requires BOLT. 
For example, in our DPO component (Decentralized Programmable Organization), projects have a way to define 
specific goals for communities via DPO. To use the DPO component, internal components like Spanner's vault component 
which stores funds from DPO Members will require BOLT to operate. In other words, BOLT is required to fuel 
all components used within a transaction on Spanner. Although each project may have their own tokens, BOLT will be required
to pay for transactions, similar to Ethereum gas fees.
