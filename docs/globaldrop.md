A Milestone Drop is a scheduled token airdrop for hitting a milestone, which can be flexibly defined. In our first launch, a Milestone Drop is activatd by metrics of Growth Box and DPO and its token reward package will be fairly distributed to the target audiences. It is like how Uniswap/1inch airdrop tokens for their early backers. 

For example, 
- drop 10000 BOLT tokens to all Growth Box committers when totally 5 Growth Boxes were activated.
- drop 10000 BOLT tokens to all DPO managers when  totally 15 Growth Boxes were activated.

Anyone who want to incentivize community growth can schedule a Milestone Drop.
