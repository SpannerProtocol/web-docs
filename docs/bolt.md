### Issuance and Distribution

Total BOLT issuance = 1,000,000,000
- Token sales (0%): It is noteworthy that the Spanner Protocol was initially developed at the expense of the founding members who provided the initial idea, engineering efforts and capital needed to bootstrap the protocol. No initial token sales also gives the benefit that no major token holders can ruin the market with early token dumps. 
- Team (8%): Scheduled to linearly vest to Spanner core developers over a 4-year period after Jan 1st of 2022. This is to ensure both long-term commitment and short term market stability. The list of beneficiary wallets of core developers will be public for community review. 
- Early Growth (32%): Used for creating GrowthBox or other growth-oriented offerings that incentivse early token holders, partners and project launching on Spanner.   
- Protocol Validators(20%): In the [Spanner Mainnet phase](launch_phases.md), Spanner needs to incentivise validators via the nominated Proof of State protocol. [Spanner Parachain phase](launch_phases.md), Spanner needs to incentives community helping the parachain slot auctioning via [Initial Parachain Offering](https://defidao.medium.com/polkadot-dot-reveals-details-of-initial-parachain-offering-ipo-launch-69a8aa23ee88) or an equivalent model.
- Treasury Reserve (40%): It is of vital importance for the protocol to be agile (futureproof) to the future technological disruption or token model innovations. The reserver gives Spanner Protocol the flexibility to be on par with future innovations. Treasury usage will be determined through the formal governance model.
